### This project is an unnoficial Fabric port of [Better Flight [Forge]](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-flight-forge) by [ArkVeil](https://www.curseforge.com/members/arkveil/projects).

### The port was created by [AtlasM8](https://modrinth.com/user/AtlasM8) using AI and [NotchArrow](https://modrinth.com/user/NotchArrow) doing bugfixes in the process.

# Description
Flapping your wings **Default: Z** allows you to gain a boost by consuming flight stamina, which recharges from hunger.

Flaring your wings **Default: X** slows down your flight so that you can make decisions in midair.

# Dependencies
### üíç [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)

This mod requires Trinkets to run because the project is meant to be used with [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot), a mod that uses Trinkets to allow you to equip your chestplate and elytra at the same time. You can install Trinkets without the other mod, but it will not provide the same functionality.
